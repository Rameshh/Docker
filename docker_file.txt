* Virtualization: Run multiple application on same machine. bulky in size, running multiple virtual machine leads to unstable performance, bootup take a long time, VM's would not solve the problems like portability, software updates, continous integration and continous deployment.

* Containerization is a type of virtualization which brings virtualization to the operating system level.
* Reason to use containers.
1. Containers have no guest OS and use the host's operating system. So, they share relevant libraries and resources as and when needed.
2. Processing and execution of applications are very fast since application specific binaries and libraries of containers run on the host kernel.
3. Booting up a container takes only a fraction of a second, and also containers are lightweight and faster than virtual machines.

* Docker is a platform which packages an application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers.
* Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text document which contains all the commands that a user can call on the command line to assemble an image. docker build to create an automated build to execute.

* Docker Image: Docker Image can be compared to a template which is used to create Docker Containers.
docker run to run the image and create container.
Docker images are stored in the Docker Registry.

* Docker Container: Docker Container is a running instance of a Docker image as they hold the entire package needed to run the application.

* Docker Compose: Docker compose is a YAML file which contains details about the services, networks, and volumes for setting up the Docker application.

* Docker Swarm: Docker Swarm is a technique to create and maintain a cluster of Docker Engines.

* Docker file containes below commands.
1. FROM: Specifies the image that has to be downloaded
2. MAINTAINER: Metadata of the owner who owns the image
3. RUN: Specifies the commands to be executed
4. ENTRYPOINT: Specifies the command which will be executed first
5. EXPOSE: Specifies the port on which the container is exposed

* Install Docker on Ubuntu
1. Let us update the packages.
   sudo apt-get update
2. Install the recommended packages.
   sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual
3. Install docker engine.
   sudo apt-get install docker-engine
4. Start the docker service.
   sudo service docker start
5. pull a CentOs image from docker hub and run the CentOs container.
   sudo docker pull centos
   sudo docker run -it centos
   
* Install Docker on CentOS
1. Update the system packages and install the required dependencies.
   sudo yum update
   sudo yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
2. Add the Docker stable repository to your system.
   sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
3. Install the Docker.
   sudo yum install docker-ce
4. Start the Docker daemon and enable it to automatically start at boot time.
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
5. To verify the Docker service is running.
   sudo systemctl status docker
6. To check Docker version.
   docker -v
